# MNIST-Data-by-CNN
This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits that is commonly used as a benchmark for image classification models.

## Introduction
This project aims to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset with a high degree of accuracy. The project uses the Keras API with the TensorFlow backend to build and train the model.

## Technologies
The project uses the following technologies:
-Python 3.x
-TensorFlow 2.x 
- pandas
- NumPy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
